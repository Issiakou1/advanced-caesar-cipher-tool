## Installation

To get started with the Advanced Caesar Cipher Tool, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Issiakou1/advanced-caesar-cipher-tool/releases). After downloading, extract the files and run the program according to the instructions in the README file.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations.

## Usage

Once you have installed the tool, you can start using it right away. Here‚Äôs a quick guide on how to use the features:

1. **Open the Tool**: Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files and run the main script.
2. **Select Your Operation**: Choose whether you want to encrypt, decrypt, or analyze a text.
3. **Input Your Text**: Enter the text you want to work with.
4. **View Results**: The tool will display the results based on your selected operation.

For detailed instructions, refer to the documentation provided in the repository.

## How It Works

The Advanced Caesar Cipher Tool implements the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm with added functionalities. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the main components:

### Encryption

The encryption process involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.

### Decryption

Decryption reverses the encryption process. The tool can automatically detect the shift value or use brute force to test all possible shifts.

### Cryptanalysis

The tool includes frequency analysis to help identify the most common letters in the ciphertext. This method can significantly speed up the decryption process.
